# First Workshop on Ancient Language Processing
## Co-located with [RANLP 2023](https://ranlp.org/ranlp2023/) at Varna, Bulgaria

Ancient languages contain rich human historical and cultural wealth. So far there has been some good advancement in applying language technologies to ancient languages such as Sumerian, Akkadian, Latin, Ancient Greek and Ancient Chinese, especially in the construction of digital language resources and resources to facilitate automatic analysis. The workshop on Ancient Language Processing aims to focus specifically on ancient languages and scripts from the emergence of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt c. 3000 BCE to the entire world up till 800 AD. We wish to provide a recognized forum to further advance this subfield of NLP, where researchers and practitioners can meet and discuss their latest work, and exchange ideas in addressing shared epigraphical challenges in language processing across various ancient languages, such as non-Latin and non-alphabetic scripts, Right-to-Left, transliteration conventions and fragmentary texts. In addition, we propose shared tasks on Machine Translation for Ancient Chinese and Akkadian, respectively, to provide an opportunity to address the unique challenges faced by ancient language machine translation.

# Submission Guidelines (üí• *TBD*) 

We welcome two kinds of submissions:
* Long Papers must describe original and unpublished work in any topic area of the workshop. Long papers are limited to 8 pages for content, with 2 additional pages for references.
* Short Papers may describe either work in progress or a research proposal. They may also be in the style of a position paper that surveys and criticizes existing literature. Short papers must include clear directions for future research. Submissions of this type are limited to 4 pages for content, with 2 additional pages for references.

Please also note the following:
* The papers accepted at RANLP and the associated workshops are included in the ACL Anthology. All accepted papers have DOI numbers. The RANLP proceedings are indexed by SCOPUS and DBLP.
* Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available from [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Please submit your papers in PDF format. 
* The review will be double-blind. Please do not include any self-identifying information in the submission. This includes anonymizing the already-published work by removing acknowledgments, self-citations, etc.

### Submission can be made through this link (coming soon)
